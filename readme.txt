Purpose of the script: 

To produce a list of all Fields within each feature class (both raster and vector) within each GDB database and thence produce a list of filenames and their paths and folder structure. 

Output Fields dot py is a short script which outputs all field names for one feature class within one GDB. 

I would like to be able to write a function which outputs all field names for each feature class within a single workspace.
